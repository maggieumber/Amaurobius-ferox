We are hungry! We are hungry! Feed us mother!

Thank you for this egg. It is tasty! We are full and happy!

Look how we grow. Our bodies buldging! Too tight! Too tight! We must shed our skin!

We are big and hungry! But we ate the egg! We will starve!

What is that? We feel it! Our bodies are vibrating!
