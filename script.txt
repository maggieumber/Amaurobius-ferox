We are hungry! We are hungry! Feed us mother!

Thank you for this egg. It is tasty! We are full and happy!

Look how we grow. Our bodies buldging! Too tight! Too tight! We must shed our skin!

We are big and hungry! But we ate the egg! We will starve!

What is this? We tremble! Our bodies are vibrating!

Food! Where is the food that shakes our web?

It presses down onto us! This food! It wants us to feed!

Our fangs find flesh! Our venom courses through its body!

You are disolving beneath us mother! 

You have made us hunters!
