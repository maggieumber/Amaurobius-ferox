Recently I heard a trailer for a new podcast series from the creators of the Criminal podcast. 
It's called [This Is Love.](https://www.thisislovepodcast.com/) 

It contained the story of the female [Amaurobius ferox, the Black Lace Weaver Spider](http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8757000/8757771.stm) and her babies.
