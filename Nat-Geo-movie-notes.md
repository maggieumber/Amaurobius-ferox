# [Mother-Eating Spiders](https://youtu.be/coUd6d3j_6g)

A week ago around a hundred spiderlings hatched. They are destined to be ferocious predators, but right now these babies are helpless and rely on mom to provide them with sacs of specially laid eggs to eat.
But the food soon runs out and as the spiders shed their skin for the first time and begin to grow, they need more.
And mother has nothing left to give. Or does she?
Soon the babies will have to hunt for themselves, but they can't yet, because their predatory instinct hasn't been triggered. 
It's about to be.
The mother circles the youngsters tapping and vibrating the web and something awakens in the spiderlings.
They swarm in a frenzy, aware somehow that when something stirs near the web, it's time to eat.
The mother then presses herself into her babies, stimulating instinct even more. Then the final switch is flicked, and they attack.
They sink their hundreds of tiny fangs into her and for the first time in their lives, inject venom into prey. It will disolve her from the inside out. It's called [matriphagy](https://www.google.com/search?ei=hGrGWv-8F6Ol_QbGsYLgDg&q=matgraphagy&oq=matgraphagy&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i13k1l6j0i13i30k1l4.833392.837935.0.838194.11.11.0.0.0.0.175.1011.9j2.11.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..0.10.890...0j35i39k1j0i131k1j0i67k1j0i10k1j0i30k1j0i10i30k1j0i5i30k1j0i13i10i30k1j0i13i5i30k1.0.x9H96UIpCIE).
