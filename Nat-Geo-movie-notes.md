# [Mother-Eating Spiders](https://youtu.be/coUd6d3j_6g)

A week ago around a hundred spiderlings hatched. They are destined to be ferocious predators, but right now these babies are helpless and rely on mom to provide them with sacs of specially laid eggs to eat.
But the food soon runs out and as the spiders shed their skin for the first time and begin to grow, they need more.
And mother has nothing left to give. Or does she?
Soon the babies will have to hunt for themselves, but they can't yet, because their predatory instinct hasn't been triggered.
